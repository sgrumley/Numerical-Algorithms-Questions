The depths of a river H are measured at equally spaced distances across a channel as tabulated below. 
The rivers cross-sectional area can be determined by integration as in: 

𝐴c = Ux->0 𝐻(𝑥)𝑑𝑥

Write a C++ program that uses Romberg integration to perform the integration to a stopping criterion of 1%
